# Price the Vintage

[price-the-vintage](https://catalogs.wine-qa.library.ucdavis.edu.),
(https://catalogs.wine-qa.library.ucdavis.edu.). Is an effort from the UC Davis
library to use crowd-sourcing to mine wine price information from historical
documents. The overall goal is to provide bottle costs for various types of wine
to help chart the changing tastes of the public, and the wine industries
response to those changes.

Currently, our corpus consists of 197 Sherry-Lehmann catalogs.  These combine
wine prices with some gorgeous commericial art from the 50's through the 70's.
