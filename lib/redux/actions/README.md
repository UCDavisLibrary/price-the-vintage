## Redux Actions

The files in this folder contain action definitions as well set methods to generate
redux actions.  For the most part, these modules will be imported by the controllers
and triggered on the redux store whenever the appropriate method is called.

The redux reducers will import the ACTION enums as well.  So they can be checked in the switch statement.
