# Price the Vintage

Thanks for thinking about contributing to our efforts. We are currently looking
for alpha testers for
our
[price-the-vintage application](https://catalogs.wine-qa.library.ucdavis.edu.),
(https://catalogs.wine-qa.library.ucdavis.edu.). We are interested in input on
all aspects of the application; including; any bugs in the existing code;
suggestions on the operation; and suggestions on the data that we are
collecting.  If you identify a problem, please submit
a [New Issue](https://github.com/UCDavisLibrary/price-the-vintage/issues/new).

# BEWARE!

Please be aware that we are in the early stages of development.  This means many
aspects of the application will change.

*Most Importantly!* The user data is currently emphemeral.  That means that any
marks you make will probably disappear, and at any time.  Do not make marks with
the expectation of recovering that data in any way.
